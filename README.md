    - Python
    - jupyter notebook      
* [Conclusions](#conclusions)
    - Loan Grade D,E,F and G has higher % of Defaulters ~50% in comparision of  ~28% for fully paid

- General Information: A consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

- DataSet :  The data given below contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not.
